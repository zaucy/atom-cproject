CProject aims to provide similar functionality to [QT Creator's CMake Project setup](https://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator-3.1/creator-project-cmake.html) in the [Atom](http://atom.io) text editor.

At this time it's only an idea that I am casually working on. If you'd like to contribute I'd be more than happy to receive.
